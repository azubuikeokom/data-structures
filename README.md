# data-structures
implementations of different data structures in JavaScript.
Just so you know, I implemented this data structure with the help Micheal Mcmilian's book on data-structures and algorithms with javascript. I followed his explanation; and oh, he does explains really well. However, I implemented all data structures here myself- writing my own code.
