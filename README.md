# data-structures
implementations of different data structures in JavaScript.
Just so you know, I implemented these data-structures with the help of Micheal Mcmilian's book on data-structures and algorithms with javascript. I followed his explanation; and oh, he does explains really well. However, I implemented all data-structures here myself- writing my own code.
As i progress on this course, I will improve every bit of code I have written to make its time and space complexity much better. The "find" subroutine that I wrote for  the BST isn't really the best; I will definitely improve the code and make it much cleaner.
